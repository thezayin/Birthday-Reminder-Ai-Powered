## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Birthday Reminder app is engineered following **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase. The UI leverages the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** pattern for predictable state management.

### Layered Structure

1.  **Domain Layer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Encapsulates the core business logic, application-specific rules, and common models. It's platform-independent.
    *   **Components:** Data Models (e.g., `Birthday`, `GiftIdea`), Repository Interfaces (e.g., `BirthdayRepository`, `GiftRepository`), and Use Cases (e.g., `AddBirthdayUseCase`, `GenerateGiftIdeaUseCase`).

2.  **Data Layer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer, handling data retrieval and storage. It interacts with various data sources.
    *   **Components:** Repository Implementations, Data Sources (Local: **Room Database** DAOs; Remote: **Ktor API services** for AI, **Firebase Remote Config** for dynamic data). Mapper functions handle conversions between data source-specific entities and domain models.

3.  **Presentation Layer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the user interface and user interactions.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **View Models (using `StateFlow`):** Hold the UI state and process user `Intent`s, orchestrating calls to the Domain Layer. State updates are exposed via `StateFlow` for reactive UIs.
        *   **Composables (Jetpack Compose):** Render the UI elements based on the state observed from View Models, and emit user `Intent`s (actions) back to the View Model.

### MVI Pattern

The **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** pattern is explicitly adopted within the Presentation layer to achieve:

*   **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Strict flow of data (User Intent -> View Model -> State -> UI).
*   **Predictable State:** The UI is a pure function of state, making it easy to understand and debug.
*   **Clear Actions:** User interactions are modeled as explicit `Intent` objects.

### Multi-Modular Setup

The project is structured into multiple Gradle modules for better organization, separation of concerns, and build performance:

*   **`core:data`**: Contains data source implementations and repository implementations.
*   **`core:domain`**: Houses core business logic, models, and use cases.
*   **`core:values`**: Shared resources like strings, drawables, fonts.
*   **`feature:add_birthday`**: Manages the logic and UI for adding and editing birthday entries.
*   **`feature:age_calculator`**: Handles age calculation logic and UI.
*   **`feature:gift_idea`**: Encapsulates AI-powered gift idea generation.
*   **`feature:home`**: The main application dashboard.
*   **`feature:settings`**: Manages user preferences and app settings.
*   **`feature:splash`**: Handles app startup, onboarding, and splash screen.
*   **`app`**: The main application module, integrating all feature modules and configuring global settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies & Libraries

This application is built with a modern Android tech stack, leveraging popular and robust libraries:

*   **Platform:** Android Native
*   **Language:** **Kotlin**
*   **UI Framework:** **Jetpack Compose** (Declarative UI)
*   **Dependency Injection:** **Koin** (Lightweight DI framework)
*   **Persistence:** **Room Database** (for local data persistence like birthdays)
*   **Networking:** **Ktor Client** (Asynchronous HTTP requests, used for Gemnie AI API)
*   **AI Integration:** **Gemnie AI (via Ktor)** for personalized gift suggestions. *(While TensorFlow is mentioned, if the direct AI calls are via Ktor to Gemnie, it's the primary AI interaction. TensorFlow might be for on-device aspects if any).*

    *   **Firebase Analytics:** For tracking user engagement and events.
    *   **Firebase Crashlytics:** For real-time crash reporting.
    *   **Firebase Remote Config:** For dynamic management of app configurations (e.g., ad settings).
*   **Notification Management:** **Android Notification API** with **AlarmManager** for birthday reminders.
*   **Image Loading:** **Coil Compose** (Asynchronous image loading)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running:

### Prerequisites

*   **Android Studio** (latest stable version recommended)
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11** or higher
*   An **Android device or emulator** running API 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop) or higher.

### Installation & Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thezayin/AI-Birthday-Reminder.git
    cd AI-Birthday-Reminder
    ```

2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Launch Android Studio and select `File > Open`.
    *   Navigate to the cloned `AI-Birthday-Reminder` directory and click `Open`.

3.  **Sync Gradle Project:**
    *   Android Studio will automatically try to sync the Gradle project. If it doesn't, click the `Sync Project with Gradle Files` button (üêò icon) in the toolbar.

4.  **Firebase & Gemnie AI Setup:**
    *   **`google-services.json`:** For Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and Remote Config, place your `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory. Follow the official [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) for detailed setup.
    *   **Gemnie AI API Key:** If a Gemnie AI API key is required and not dynamically fetched via Firebase Remote Config, ensure it's configured as a `buildConfigField` in your `build.gradle.kts` files or through secure means.

5.  **Run the application:**
    *   Select the `app` module in the Gradle pane.
    *   Choose your desired device/emulator from the run configurations dropdown.
    *   Click the `Run 'app'` button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to build and install the application.

### Customization Tips

*   **Notification Settings:** Modify the notification logic within the relevant modules (`feature:add_birthday` or `feature:settings`) to adjust default times or reminder types.
*   **AI Model Parameters:** If your AI integration allows, adjust input parameters for the Gemnie AI calls (e.g., in `feature:gift_idea`) to fine-tune gift suggestions.
*   **Gift Generation Fields:** Extend the gift idea input fields to collect more specific user data for even more personalized recommendations.
